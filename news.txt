Per popular request, I have added the short term forecast back on the main page.  I have also changed the way that the webcams are shown and have added a new webcam page.</br>

I have made extensive changes today and last night.  Everything under the Forecast, 
Data, Mesonet, and Space tabs work.  I have also added additional pages (Rain Detail, etc)
to some of the content.  I'm also tweaking the page layout a bit and fixed a few bugs (like
the Warning box that had a bad link).<br/><br/>
If you have any comments, suggestions, etc, please send them my way at <span class="badge badge-info">jrandow at ctetg dot com</span>.
